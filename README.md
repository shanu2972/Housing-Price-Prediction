# Housing-Price-Prediction

This machine learning project is to predict house prices based on various features using a dataset. By leveraging Python and popular libraries such as Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and RandomForest, I built a predictive model that can estimate house prices with reasonable accuracy.
